## Contribute

This is your site!  You can make it better!  

The easiest way is to provide fresh content!  If you have a business logo, a picture of a menu, or an updated special, use the form on the right.

We are also looking for  contributors.  If you have project management skills, enjoy wranging data, like scouring Facebook groups, or know your way around CSS, we'd love to have you on the team.  

You can find us in the [proj-eugene-food-scene channel](https://eugenetech.slack.com/archives/C0111JBQB63) on the [EugeneTech Slack](http://eugslack.com)
